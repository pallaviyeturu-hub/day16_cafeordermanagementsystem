\##  Description



This project is a \*Cafe Order Management System\* written in C language.  

It simulates a simple cafe billing system where multiple customers can place orders from a fixed menu of five items.  

For each customer, the program takes item numbers and quantities, calculates individual bills, and then displays a complete cafe summary including \*total revenue, total items sold, the most ordered item, and the least ordered item\*.  



The main focus of this project is to practice \*1D arrays, \*\*loops, and \*\*conditional statements\* to solve real-world style problems.  

The program is fully menu-driven and demonstrates how arrays and control structures can be used to process repetitive customer data efficiently.
